Demo script for the motion patterns recognition based on the accelerometer data from UCI:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms for machine learning are used
to demonstrate labeling of the varying-length sequences. It can be applied to time series classification or
other cases, which require matching / training sequences with unequal lengths.

Scikit-Learn doesn't have any DTW implementations, so a custom class has been implemented (KnnDtwClassifier)
as a part of TinyLearn module.

DTW is slow by default, taking into account its quadratic complexity, that's why we're speeding up the classification
using an alternative approach with histograms and CommonClassifier from TinyLearn.
